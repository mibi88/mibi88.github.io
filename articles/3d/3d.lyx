\begin_layout Standard
Recently I participated at a challenge,
 where in an evening we had 6 hours to make a game in Python 3 with Pyxel (it sucks).
 I really wanted to make some 3D because it's more impressive than a simple pixel art 2D game and I saw that Pyxel has a function to render colored triangles.
 It also means that I can't have any depth buffer (and I don't know the formula for perspective correct interpolation so I would not have been able to do 3D rendering with a depth buffer anyway).
 I just sorted the triangles by depth (by calculating the average of the depth of the three points,
 maybe there is a better way to do it,
 but I don't know any) with some selection sort (maybe insertion sort may have been better,
 or maybe it isn't because it doesn't always take the same time so maybe the framerate would have been less consistent).
 Some formulas are also required to render 3D (I didn't used matrices because I haven't seen them at school yet:
 I'm still very young,
 and the little I know about them,
 because I use matrices in MibiEngine2 would not have been enough).
 So I used some formulas I found on the web a long time ago (it isn't online anymore but it got archived by the Wayback Machine:

 but the formula for projection isn't correct and I didn't implemented one of the rotation formulas correctly:

 axis.
 I really hate AIs because they're crawling forges so intensively and require a lot of energy,
 but ChatGPT was really helpful here to get the formulas I needed.
 I also found one of them on Wikipedia for projection.
 I'll share the formulas here because I found them very hard to find,
 and I may not be the only one that finds them useful.

Projection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the big advantages of using a projection matrix is having a near and a far plane,
 but I only knew a very approximate formula without it\SpecialChar ldots
 Today I fixed it.
 Here is the formula I'm using now:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First I calculate the focal length,
 to use the formula from Wikipedia (
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection#Diagram"
target "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection#Diagram"
literal "false"

\end_inset

):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $f=\frac{w}{2\times\tan\frac{\theta}{2}}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 being the field of view (FOV for short) and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 the width of the viewport.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Note
\series default
:
 Pyxel doesn't provide a 
\begin_inset Formula $\tan$
\end_inset

 function so I just used 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then I applied Wikipedia's formula to calculate the X and Y coordinates:
 
\begin_inset Formula $x'=x\times\frac{f}{z}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y'=y\times\frac{f}{z}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Note
\series default
:
 make sure that 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 is non-zero,
 or you will get a 
\family typewriter
ZeroDivisionError
\family default
.

Conclusion

\begin_layout Standard
All those formulas are all you should need to render very basic 3D.

You can check the code of my little 3D demo here:

I hope it can help you on your journey making a very basic software renderer :).
