<p style="margin-top: 1em">GitHub Pages imposes a big
restriction on how pages can behave as they need to be
static, which can be quite inconvenient. To make my website
easier to modify I was using some JS to load the articles in
the main page. However, it was therefore limiting it to
browsers supporting&nbsp;/&nbsp;with JS enabled, and it
isn&rsquo;t very scalable, as when there will be more and
more articles, the website will have more and more articles
to fetch and display. it was also quite annoying to write
new articles or just update the project list as I had to
write HTML, and I have an obsession of wrapping my code on
80 columns :D (actually 79) which doesn&rsquo;t work very
well when writing HTML.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That&rsquo;s why I wanted to
generate my website statically with a script. I wanted to
write an article about how I struggled trying to fix my
computer&rsquo;s cable management, but I decided to fix my
website first. Originally I wanted to use python and
something else like markdown, but finally I used bash, sed
and groff (it&rsquo;s a bit cooler :D). I&rsquo;m also
calling LyX to convert the older articles. My script is
still a bit messy, but it works nicely. It loads the lists
of articles and &ldquo;projects&rdquo; (the sections where
all my projects are listed by category, e.g.,
&ldquo;Games&rdquo; or &ldquo;Libraries&rdquo;, I
don&rsquo;t really know how to call them), where the paths
and the IDs (for articles) or the titles (for
&ldquo;projects&rdquo;) are separated by semicolons. The
most recent articles are listed first. My script then walks
through these lists and generates the HTML code with the
appropriate tool. Then I use sed a bunch to remove all the
superfluous HTML that would make the generated HTML invalid
(when viewing the source code via Firefox, it seems to be
unhappy with the header and footer, but that&rsquo;s because
my template HTML code itself is incorrect&mdash;I&rsquo;m
not writing HTML very often&mdash;and I didn&rsquo;t know
that &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; must be inside
&lt;body&gt;). Then I use sed again to replace
{&lt;name&gt;} tags with the appropriate generated HTML,
such as {article_list} which gets replaced with a list of
links to all the articles. I should run sed over the
articles and &ldquo;projects&rdquo; as well to replace curly
braces with an escape sequence to avoid such tags to get
replaced in the articles&rsquo; content, but I&rsquo;ll fix
that later. I&rsquo;m also generating PDFs of the articles
because I can (lol), but I don&rsquo;t include them in the
git repo. I&rsquo;ve already an idea of a little Easter egg
that I could add with a little bit of JS, but I&rsquo;ll do
it later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So that&rsquo;s how I statically
generate my website without using a premade solution. In the
end it took me way longer than I expected, but it was quite
fun! roff is fascinating, maybe I&rsquo;ll code my own
implementation of it at some point....</p></div>
