<p style="margin-top: 1em">My PC&rsquo;s cable management
was until recently really messy. When rendering the
time-lapse of my participation at the 58th Ludum Dare, I
decided to tackle this issue as my computer was really
noisy, which made the long hours of encoding a
3000&times;1920 video very painful, especially as it
hadn&rsquo;t finished before I wanted to go to bed. The
issue was that my computer was vibrating a lot, which
produced a lot of noise as it sits on my desk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So I wired things nicely, except
the EPS cable as it was too short, it still had to uglily
run over the whole motherboard. I hadn&rsquo;t connected my
old hard drives back as I rarely use them, and the thermals
had improved, even if I&rsquo;d noticed that I had mounted
my CPU&rsquo;s cooler the wrong way around after having
repasted it a while ago. Seeing this huge improvement I
bought some fancy new individually sleeved cables from
Corsair, as it&rsquo;s my PSU&rsquo;s brand, to have a
longer EPS cable, an easier to bend ATX cable (actually it
became really painful to let the new cable correctly on the
back of the case while still being able to close it), and a
PCI cable without the little daisy-chaining dongle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once I had finally managed to
close the case and all the cables were wired nicely, I
booted my computer&nbsp;... and was very disappointed that
it was noisy, as I had tested it before being fully done and
everything was quite quiet, and the thermals were good as
well. So I quickly noticed that before, I hadn&rsquo;t
connected the hard drives, and I found out that one of my
hard drives was vibrating a lot. So I took it out of the
computer and noticed that it was only held by a single
screw&mdash;I really don&rsquo;t know what I had thought
when I had screwed it down with a single, with a unique
screw! I added 3 more, but it was still vibrating a lot. The
weird thing being, that the other one, which is older, is
completely fine. I haven&rsquo;t investigated it that much
more. I didn&rsquo;t know before that hard drives spin even
if they aren&rsquo;t mounted! So I tried to set a timeout
after which they spin down, but it didn&rsquo;t work, so I
just disconnected them, as I rarely need them, and now
everything is fine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So actually I don&rsquo;t really
know how useful good cable management is (lol). A positive
aspect is that my computer now runs a little cooler, after I
repasted my CPU to put the cooler the right way
around&mdash;what a dumb mistake!&mdash;and flipped my PSU
upside-down, as I can mount it both ways around. I had let
it take air in from the inside of the computer case before,
which probably wasn&rsquo;t a good idea, so I mounted it so
that it takes the air in from under the computer, which
should keep it cooler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At least now it looks nicer, and
it probably helped a little as I&rsquo;d seen with my first
try at improving the cable management, to keep it a little
cooler.</p></div>
